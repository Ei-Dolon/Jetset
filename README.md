# Jetset
Project containing website implementation,  development, configuration, reference sources, etc. for the Jetset BEP20 token, Jetset Lux NFT, as part of the luxury rental platform.
Websites for information and interaction and to form the frontend of the dApp which will offer luxury rentals across multiple sectors.

Currently two domain names registered:
jetsettoken.com - BEP-20 utility token to be used to achieve discounts on the luxury rentals and wellness lifestyle platform
jetsetlux.com - NFT rental website introduction becoming the frontend of the dApp

Jetset makes use of a website to interact with the public (investors and prospective investors).
The original fungible token uses the web resources hosted at the domain  jetsettoken.com
The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) uses the web resources hosted at the domain  jetsetlux.com

The website will also be extended to form one of the frondend interfaces for the Jetset dApp which intially will form a luxury L.A. property rental dApp based on NFT's on the BNB Smart Chain, with associated wallet showing current wallet address links to the tokens BNB, JST and any NFTs.

NFT ownership of each asset (luxury property, luxury vehicle, or luxury service) is minted on the blockchain, metadata holds all of the details that uniquely identify the asset).
NFT rental protocols provide the infrastructure to transfer NFT user rights for a limited period without transferring the NFT ownership.

For property rental, the intial assets to be released upon the platform, the blockchain NFTs:
 - Aim to revolutionize real estate rental by enabling property tokenization, offering enhanced global liquidity, and facilitating fractional ownership. 
- Ensures secure, transparent, and expedited real estate rental transactions, minimizing traditional procedural hassles.

A renter will deposit the necessary collateral to rent the NFT as well as paying any gas fee's for any changes to a booking after it has been made.
This provides the renter with the rights to use that property (within limits) during their rental period.

The dApp will likely be using Node.js/Express.js as linking via Quicknode to the BNB Smart Chain which will contain the backend code (Solidity smart contracts).
