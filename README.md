# Jetset
Project containing website implementation,  development, configuration, reference sources, etc. for the Jetset BEP20 token.

Currently two domain names registered:
jetsettoken.com
jetsetlux.com

Jetset makes use of a website to interact with the public (investors and prospective investors).
The original fungible token uses the web resources hosted at the domain  jetsettoken.com
The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) uses the web resources hosted at the domain  jetsetlux.com

The website will also be extended to form one of the interfaces for the Jetset wallet.  The jetset wallet will use a MVVM or MVP framework to include view-models for PC, Mac, Linux, Android App, Apple App.

Can use web3.js library and web3-react API or Binance's provider API to create a full-featured web3 wallet application.

web3-react library was used to make a tiny lib bsc-connector that implements the AbstractConnector interface.
