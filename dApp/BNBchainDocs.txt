BNB Chain Development (Video Series)
Tutorial on How to Build on BNB Chain


BNB Smart Chain is a 100% EVM compatible blockchain, and is one of the prime choices for decentralized application (dApp) development within many possible verticals including DeFi, NFT, Gaming, and many others.

Tools: https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/learn/ecosystem

https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/rpc

JSON-RPC endpoints refers to the network location where a program could transfer its RPC requests to access server data.
Once you connect a decentralized application to an RPC endpoint, you can access the functionalities of different operations, which could enable real-time usage of blockchain data.
BNB Chain provides several RPC endpoints for connectinto both its Minent and Testnet.
In this section, we list the JSON-RPC endpoints that can be used for connecting to BNB Smart Chain.

BSC Mainnet (ChainID 0x38, 56 in decimal)
https://bsc-dataseed.bnbchain.org
https://bsc-dataseed.nariox.org
https://bsc-dataseed.defibit.io
https://bsc-dataseed.ninicoin.io
https://bsc.nodereal.io
https://bsc-dataseed-public.bnbchain.org
You could find more endpoints from here.

BSC Testnet (ChainID 0x61, 97 in decimal)
https://bsc-testnet-dataseed.bnbchain.org
https://bsc-testnet.bnbchain.org
https://bsc-prebsc-dataseed.bnbchain.org

Thrid-Party RPC Providers
QuickNode: https://quicknode.com

Starting HTTP JSON-RPC
You can start the HTTP JSON-RPC with the --http flag

## mainnet
geth attach https://bsc-dataseed.bnbchain.org

## testnet
geth attach https://bsc-testnet-dataseed.bnbchain.org

Wallet Guide
What is a Wallet?
A crypto wallet is a device or program used for transfer and storage of cryptocurrency.
Crypto wallets can be of different types, such as paper wallets, hardware wallets, and software wallets.
There are also several smartphone mobile apps and computer programs that provide a user-friendly way to create and manage wallets.
Along with crytocurreny, crypto wallets store a collection of crypto keys that are used for sending, receiving, and taracking ownership of cryptocurrencies.

A keypair is a cryptographically-derived securely generated private and public keys.
A private key and its corresponding public key are together known as a keypair.
A wallet contains a collection of one or more keypairs and provides some means to interact with them.
The security of any crypto wallet depends upon how the private key is stored.

The public key is known as the wallet's receiving address or simply its address.
The wallet address may be shared and displayed freely.
When another party is going to send some amount of cryptocurrency to a wallet, they need to know the wallet's receiving address.
Depending on a blockchain's implementation, the address can also be used to view certain information about a wallet, such as viewing the balance, but has no ability to change anything about the wallet or withdraw any tokens.

In order to send cryptocurrencies to another address or to make any changes to the wallet, the private key is used for digitally signing the transactions.
It is important to note that the private key must never be shared and should always be kept securely.
If by any means access is gained to the private key attached to a wallet, the attacker can withdraw all the tokens contained.
Furthermore, if the private key for a wallet is lost, any tokens that have been sent to or stored in that wallet's address are permanently lost.

Different wallet solutions offer different approaches to keypair security, interacting with the keypair, and signing transactions to use/spend the tokens.
Some are easier to use than others. Some store and back up private keys more securely.
BNB Smart Chain supports several wallets, giving its users the right to choose the right wallet for their required security and convenience.

If you want to be able to receive BNB and other supported tokens on the BNB Smart Chain blockchain, you will first need to create a wallet and configure key management.

Key Management
This article is a guide about key management strategy on client side of your Decentralised Application on BNB Smart Chain

Setup Web3
web3.js is a javascript library that allows our client-side application to talk to the blockchain. We configure web3 to communicate via Metamask.

web3.js doc is here

Connect to BSC network
    // mainnet
     const web3 = new Web3('https://bsc-dataseed1.bnbchain.org:443');
    // testnet
    const web3 = new Web3('https://data-seed-prebsc-1-s1.bnbchain.org:8545');

Set up account
If the installation and instantiation of web3 was successful, the following should successfully return a random account:

    const account = web3.eth.accounts.create();

Recover account
If you have backup the private key of your account, you can use it to restore your account.

    const account = web3.eth.accounts.privateKeyToAccount("$private-key")

Full Example
const Web3 = require('web3');
async function main() {

    const web3 = new Web3('https://bsc-dataseed1.bnbchain.org:443');
    const loader = setupLoader({ provider: web3 }).web3;

    const account = web3.eth.accounts.create();
    console.log(account);
}

https://docs.bnbchain.org/docs/wallet_api
Binance Extension Wallet API
Binance Extension Wallet injects a global API into websites visited by its users at window.BinanceChain.

This API specification borrows heavily from API MetaMask provided, considering the massive adoption.
So Web3 site developers can easily connect their dApps with the Binance Extension Wallet.
The APIs allow websites to request users' BNB Smart Chain addresses, read data from the blockchain the user is connected to, and prompt the users to sign messages and transactions.

The presence of the provider object window.BinanceChain indicates a BNB Beacon Chain/BNB Smart Chain user.

The API this extension wallet provides includes API specified by EIP-1193 and API defined by MetaMask (including some massively relied on legacy ones).

Development Progress
Currently (version 1.112.8) as Binance Extension Wallet natively supports BNB Beacon Chain, we are planning to open a series of APIs for dApp developers to interact with BNB Beacon Chain.
At the end of the day, most APIs available in BNB Beacon Chain javascript sdk would be available.

Currently, only the following is supported:

transfer
Difference with MetaMask
!!! warning

Please read through this section if you are a Web3 developer who has integrated with MetaMask and are interested in integrating with Binance Extension Wallet.


Inpage injected object
The biggest difference between Binance Extension Wallet and MetaMask is we inject BinanceChain rather than ethereum (or web3) to the web page.
So, users could keep two extensions at the same time.

BinanceChain.request({method: "eth_sign", params: ["address", "message"])
We haven't supported the full complex signing data APIs MetaMask provided, while we only provide standard eth_sign JSON-RPC call.

The message item in params for this request on MetaMask has to be hex-encoded keccak256 hash (otherwise the API would silent failure for dapp https://www.reddit.com/r/Metamask/comments/9wp7kj/eth_sign_not_working/).
In contrast, web3 developers could pass any message in plaintext to this method, and our UI would render it as it is to the wallet users.

BinanceChain.request({method: "eth_accounts"})
When this API is invoked without the user's approval, Metamask would return an empty array.
In contrast, we would ask the user to unlock his wallet and return the address user connected to.

Upcoming Breaking Changes
!!! warning

Important Information

On **November 16, 2020**, Metamask is making changes to their provider API that will be breaking for some web3 sites.
These changes are _upcoming_, but you can prepare for them today.
Follow [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/issues/8077) for updates.

In this implementation, some APIs will be supported as [Legacy API](#legacy-api) (For example we will still implement the `chainIdChanged` on BinanceChain object until MetaMask formally deprecates it).


Basic Usage
For any non-trivial BNB Smart Chain web application — a.k.a. web3 site — to work, you will have to:

Detect the BNB Smart Chain provider (window.BinanceChain)
Detect which BNB Smart Chain network the user is connected to
Get the user's BNB Smart Chain account(s)
You can learn how to accomplish the 2 and 3 from above list by reviewing the snippet in the Using the Provider section.

The provider API is all you need to create a full-featured web3 application.

That said, many developers use a convenience library, such as ethers and web3.js, instead of using the provider directly.
If you need higher-level abstractions than those provided by this API, we recommend that you use a convenience library.

Today, many dApps are built on top of the higher-level API provided by web3-react or use-wallet (which builds on top of web3-react).

web3-react
We made a tiny lib bsc-connector that implements the AbstractConnector interface of web3-react library.
You can add this to your project in parallel with injected-connector by: yarn add @binance-chain/bsc-connector or npm i @binance-chain/bsc-connector.

import { BscConnector } from '@binance-chain/bsc-connector'

export const bsc = new BscConnector({
  supportedChainIds: [56, 97] // later on 1 ethereum mainnet and 3 ethereum ropsten will be supported
})

// invoke method on bsc e.g.
await bsc.activate();
await bsc.getAccount();
await bsc.getChainId();

use-wallet
There is an example in use-wallet origin repo shows how to 'inject' a customized web3-react connector to UseWalletProvider:

function App( ) {
  const { account, connect, reset, status } = useWallet()
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>BNB Beacon Chain Connector</h1>
      {status === 'disconnected' ? (
        <button onClick={() => connect('bsc')}>Connect</button>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => reset()}>Disconnect</button>
      )}
      {account && <p>Connected as {account}</p>}
    </div>
  )
}

render(
  <UseWalletProvider
    connectors={ {
      bsc: {
        web3ReactConnector( ) {
          return new BscConnector( { supportedChainIds: [56, 97] } )
        },
        handleActivationError(err) {
          if (err instanceof UserRejectedRequestError) {
            return new ConnectionRejectedError()
          }
        },
      },
    } }
  >
  <App />
  </UseWalletProvider>,
  document.getElementById('root')
)


Chain IDs
!!! warning

At the moment, the [`BinanceChain.chainId`](#ethereum-chainid) property and the [`chainChanged`](#chainchanged) event should be preferred over the `eth_chainId` RPC method.

Their chain ID values are correctly formatted, per the table below.

`eth_chainId` returns an incorrectly formatted (0-padded) chain ID for the chains in the table below, e.g. `0x01` instead of `0x1`.
See the [Upcoming Breaking Changes section](#upcoming-breaking-changes) for details on when the `eth_chainId` RPC method will be fixed.

Custom RPC endpoints are not affected; they always return the chain ID specified by the user.


These are the IDs of the BNB Smart Chains that Binance Extension Wallet supports by default.

Hex	Decimal	Network
0x38	56	BNB Smart Chain Main Network (bsc-mainnet)
0x61	97	BNB Smart Chain Test Network (bsc-testnet)
This API can also return chain ids of BNB Beacon Chains if users switch to them. The possible return value would be:

Chain Id	Network
Binance-Chain-Tigris	BNB Beacon Chain Main Network (bbc-mainnet)
Binance-Chain-Ganges	BNB Beacon Chain Test Network (bbc-testnet)
Properties
BinanceChain.chainId
!!! warning

The value of this property can change at any time, and should not be exclusively relied upon. See the [`chainChanged`](#chainchanged) event for details.


NOTE: See the Chain IDs section for important information about the Binance Extension Wallet provider's chain IDs.

A hexadecimal string representing the current chain ID.

BinanceChain.autoRefreshOnNetworkChange
As the consumer of this API, it is your responsibility to handle chain changes using the chainChanged event.
We recommend reloading the page on chainChange unless you have a good reason not to.

Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

To disable this behavior, set this property to false immediately after detecting the provider:

BinanceChain.autoRefreshOnNetworkChange = false;

Methods
BinanceChain.isConnected()
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

BinanceChain.isConnected(): boolean;

BinanceChain.request(args)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

We use this method to wrap an RPC API, Please see the Ethereum wiki.

Important methods from this API include:

eth_accounts
eth_call
eth_getBalance
eth_sendTransaction
eth_sign
interface RequestArguments {
  method: string;
  params?: unknown[] | object;
}

BinanceChain.request(args: RequestArguments): Promise<unknown>;

Example
The code snippet below is as same as MetaMask's example, the only difference is we injected a different object.

params: [
  {
    from: '0xb60e8dd61c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07233155',
    to: '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f07244567',
    gas: '0x76c0', // 30400
    gasPrice: '0x9184e72a000', // 10000000000000
    value: '0x9184e72a', // 2441406250
    data:
      '0xd46e8dd67c5d32be8d46e8dd67c5d32be8058bb8eb970870f072445675058bb8eb970870f072445675',
  },
];

BinanceChain
  .request({
    method: 'eth_sendTransaction',
    params,
  })
  .then((result) => {
    // The result varies by by RPC method.
    // For example, this method will return a transaction hash hexadecimal string on success.
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    // If the request fails, the Promise will reject with an error.
  });

BinanceChain.bnbSign(address: string, message: string): Promise<{publicKey: string, signature: string}>
We prepared an example for this API, please check out: https://github.com/bnb-chain/js-eth-personal-sign-examples for more detail

Like eth_sign enable dApp to verify a user has control over an ethereum address by signing an arbitrary message.
We provide this method for dApp developers to request the signature of arbitrary messages for BNB Beacon Chain (BC) and BNB Smart Chain (BSC).

If address parameter is a BNB Beacon Chain address (start with bnb or tbnb), we will simply calculate sha256 hash of the message and let the user sign the hash with their BNB Beacon Chain address' private key.
Note: BNB Beacon Chain uses the same elliptic curve (secp256k1) as Ethereum.

If address parameter is a BNB Smart Chain address (start with 0x), the message would be hashed in the same way as with eth_sign.

The returned publicKey would be a compressed encoded format (a hex string encoded 33 bytes starting with "0x02", "0x03") for BNB Beacon Chain.
And uncompressed encoded format (a hex string encoded 65 bytes starting with "0x04").

The returned signature would be bytes encoded in hex string starting with 0x.
For BinanceChain, its r,s catenated 64 bytes in total.
For BNB Smart Chain, like eth_sign, its r, s catenated 64 bytes and a recover byte in the end.

!!! warning

dApp developers should verify whether the returned public key can be converted into the address user claimed in addition to an ECDSA signature verification because any plugin can inject the same object `BinanceChain` as Binance Extension Wallet.


BinanceChain.switchNetwork(networkId: string): Promise<{networkId: string}>
As Binance Extension Wallet natively supports BNB Beacon Chain and BNB Smart Chain which are heterogeneous blockchains run in parallel.
APIs would be different in any situation. (We would open APIs for BNB Beacon Chain very soon).

Developers could judge which network is selected by users currently via BinanceChain.chainId or listening to the chainChanged event via BinanceChain.on('chainChanged', callback).

To request for network switching, developers could invoke this API with bbc-mainnet (BNB Beacon Chain Main Network), bsc-mainnet (BNB Smart Chain Main Network), bbc-testnet (BNB Beacon Chain Test Network), bsc-testnet (BNB Smart Chain Test Network) to prompt user to agree on network switching.

BinanceChain.requestAccounts()
Request all accounts maintained by this extension.

The id in response would be used as accountId for the APIs for BNB Beacon Chain.

This method would return an array of Account:

{
  addresses: [{address: string, type: string}],
  icon: string,
  id: string,
  name: string
}

For example:

[
    {
        "id":"fba0b0ce46c7f79cd7cd91cdd732b6c699440acf8c539d7e7d753d38c9deea544230e51899d5d9841b8698b74a3c77b79e70d686c76cb35dca9cac0e615628ed",

BinanceChain.transfer({fromAddress:string, toAddress:string, asset:string, amount:number, memo?: string, sequence?: number, accountId:string, networkId:string})>
Transfer certain amount of asset (BNB or BEP2) on BNB Beacon Chain.

accountId could be retrieved from the BinanceChain.requestAccounts API (id field of each account)

networkId could be bbc-mainnet or bbc-testnet

For example:

This will ask the user's approval for transferring 1 BNB to himself. BinanceChain.transfer({fromAddress:"tbnb1sndxdzsg42jg8lc0hehx8dzzpyfxrvq937mt0w", toAddress:"tbnb1sndxdzsg42jg8lc0hehx8dzzpyfxrvq937mt0w", asset:"BNB", amount:1, accountId:"fba0b0ce46c7f79cd7cd91cdd732b6c699440acf8c539d7e7d753d38c9deea544230e51899d5d9841b8698b74a3c77b79e70d686c76cb35dca9cac0e615628ed", networkId:"bbc-testnet"})

This will ask the user's approval for transferring 1 BUSD to himself. BinanceChain.transfer({fromAddress:"tbnb1sndxdzsg42jg8lc0hehx8dzzpyfxrvq937mt0w", toAddress:"tbnb1sndxdzsg42jg8lc0hehx8dzzpyfxrvq937mt0w", asset:"BUSD-BAF", amount:1, accountId:"fba0b0ce46c7f79cd7cd91cdd732b6c699440acf8c539d7e7d753d38c9deea544230e51899d5d9841b8698b74a3c77b79e70d686c76cb35dca9cac0e615628ed", networkId:"bbc-testnet"})

Legacy API
!!! warning You should never rely on any of these methods, properties, or events in practice.

This section documents MetaMask's legacy provider API.

To be compatible with existing dApps that support MetaMask, Binance Extension Wallet implements them as well, but please don't rely on them.
We may deprecate them soon in the future.

Legacy Properties
BinanceChain.networkVersion (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

BinanceChain.selectedAddress (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

Legacy Methods
BinanceChain.enable() (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

BinanceChain.sendAsync() (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

interface JsonRpcRequest {
  id: string | undefined;
  jsonrpc: '2.0';
  method: string;
  params?: Array<any>;
}

interface JsonRpcResponse {
  id: string | undefined;
  jsonrpc: '2.0';
  method: string;
  result?: unknown;
  error?: Error;
}

type JsonRpcCallback = (error: Error, response: JsonRpcResponse) => unknown;

BinanceChain.sendAsync(payload: JsonRpcRequest, callback: JsonRpcCallback): void;

BinanceChain.send() (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

BinanceChain.send(
  methodOrPayload: string | JsonRpcRequest,
  paramsOrCallback: Array<unknown> | JsonRpcCallback,
): Promise<JsonRpcResponse> | void;

This method behaves unpredictably and should be avoided at all costs.
It is essentially an overloaded version of BinanceChain.sendAsync().

BinanceChain.send() can be called in three different ways:

// 1.
BinanceChain.send(payload: JsonRpcRequest, callback: JsonRpcCallback): void;

// 2.
BinanceChain.send(method: string, params?: Array<unknown>): Promise<JsonRpcResponse>;

// 3.
BinanceChain.send(payload: JsonRpcRequest): unknown;

You can think of these signatures as follows:

This signature is exactly like BinanceChain.sendAsync()

This signature is like an async BinanceChain.sendAsync() with method and params as arguments, instead of a JSON-RPC payload and callback

This signature enables you to call the following RPC methods synchronously:

eth_accounts
eth_coinbase
eth_uninstallFilter
net_version
Legacy Events
close (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

BinanceChain.on('close', handler: (error: Error) => void);

chainIdChanged (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

BinanceChain.on('chainChanged', handler: (chainId: string) => void);

networkChanged (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

BinanceChain.on('networkChanged', handler: (networkId: string) => void);

notification (DEPRECATED)
Please refer to MetaMask Doc, the only difference is we injected a different object.

BinanceChain.on('notification', handler: (payload: any) => void);
