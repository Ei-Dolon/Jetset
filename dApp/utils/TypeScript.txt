TypeScript is a new language that compiles to pretty human read-able and efficient JavaScript while adding some desirable features:

optional static typing – catch errors while making them
lots of EcmaScript 6 features – arrow functions, classes with inheritance, modules
much better editor support – autocompletion and error highlighting in Visual Studio

Developing a large C++ and JavaScript project, need documentation for both programming languages.
The main requirements for the documentation are:

Application Programming Interface (API) references and general documentation such as quick start and detailed guides
cross references between the API references and the guides
