PageSpeed-For websites and dApp frontends

Google hosted libraries

	Structured Page Fragments (SPF) is a lightweight JS framework for fast navigation and page updates from YouTube, using progressive enhancement and HTML5.
	link to SPF via Google Hosted Libraries for speed (no need to install on server and access)
		<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/spf/2.4.0/spf.js"></script>
	but install version to use and test locally
		npm install spf
	SPF client is a single ~10KB Universal Module Definition JS file with no dependencies - can be async delay-loaded, all func exposed via global spf object
	add SPF to site by including the JS file and run:
		<script>
			spf.init();
		</script>

	Send requests:
	SPF does not change your site's navigation automatically and instead uses progressive enhancement to enable dynamic navigation for certain links.
	Just add a spf-link class to an <a> tag to activate SPF.

	Go from static navigation:
		<a href="/destination">Go!</a>
	to dynamic navigation:
		<!-- Link enabled: a SPF request will be sent -->
		<a class="spf-link" href="/destination">Go!</a>

	Return responses:
	In static navigation, an entire HTML page is sent. In dynamic navigation, only fragments are sent, using JSON as transport.
	When SPF sends a request to the server, it appends a configurable identifier to the URL so that your server can properly handle the request. (By default, this will be ?spf=navigate.)
	Common layout - upper masthead, middle content, lower footer.
	In dynamic navigation, only the fragment for the middle content is sent, since the masthead and footer don't change.

	Go from static navigation:		GET /destination

	<html>
		<head>
			<!-- Styles -->
		</head>
		<body>
			<div id="masthead">...</div>
			<div id="content">
			<!-- Content -->
			</div>
			<div id="footer">...</div>
			<!-- Scripts -->
		</body>
	</html>

	to dynamic navigation:		GET /destination?spf=navigate

	{
		"head": "<!-- Styles -->",
		"body": {
			"content":
				"<!-- Content -->",
		},
		"foot": "<!-- Scripts -->"
	}
