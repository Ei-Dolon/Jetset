malinka
https://github.com/LefterisJP/malinka
Malinka is a project management Emacs package for C/C++
It acts as a glue between different C/C++ packages to provide them with the right data for a project. All the data are organized and can be configured on a per project basis. The packages that malinka can work with are:

rtags
Rtags help the user jump around the code easily and provide integration with many clang utilities like Clang fixits. The main functionality that malinka provides is to properly populate and communicate the compiler commands to the rtags daemons depending on the project you are working on.
If you have not installed rtags yet, visit their github page and read more information about how you can acquire and use rtags. Alternatively if you used el-get to get malinka rtags should have been downloaded and built as a dependency

auto-complete

flycheck
Optionally and if you also have flycheck with the clang syntax-checker activated, malinka will communicate to flycheck’s clang syntax checker the appropriate cpp-defines and include-paths so that flycheck can do its syntax checking.

projectile
If you are using projectile then malinka can provide projectile with the compile and test commands to build and test your project respectively. Projectile also helps with the detection of root directory for projects.

optional:

magit

helm

Frontend Development - Website/dApp:
;************************

The part of a website where the user interacts directly is termed as front end. It is also referred to as the ‘client side’ of the application.

HTML: used to make the structure of a website.
CSS: used to style a website.
JavaScript: provides dynamic behavior to a website.


CSS Frameworks
	Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source tool collection for creating responsive websites and web applications.
		It is the most popular CSS framework for developing responsive, mobile-first websites.
		Now websites are perfect for all browsers (IE, Firefox, and Chrome) and for all sizes of screens (Desktop, Tablets, Phablets, and Phones).

Web3. js is a collection of libraries that allow users to interact between smart contracts and the front end.
It is used to develop websites that can interact with different blockchains.

Ethereum-based applications can interact with developers through a set of APIs provided by Web3.js.
These APIs include:
	Web3: It is the main interface for interacting with Ethereum Blockchain. It provides functions for interacting with contracts, accounts, and the Ethereum main network or test network.
	Eth: It is an interface for interacting with the Ethereum network. It provides functions for querying the network and sending transactions.
	Contract: It provides an interface for interacting with smart contracts. It provides the functionality for interacting, deploying, and listening to events from deployed smart contracts.


;************************
Backend  Development - Website/dApp:
;************************

Backend is the server side of a website.
It is part of the website that users cannot see and interact with.
It is the portion of software that does not come in direct contact with the users.
It is used to store and arrange data.

Back End Frameworks and Technology:

PHP: PHP is a server-side scripting language designed specifically for web development.

	Framework: Laravel

	CMS: WordPress, Joomla, Drupal, Magento

	Testing: PHPUnit

	Package Manager: Composer


Python: Python is a programming language that lets you work quickly and integrate systems more efficiently.

	Framework: Django, Flask

	Package Manager: Python PIP


Node.js: An open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside a browser.
	It provides an event-driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.
	Use NodeJS for building back-end services like APIs, Web App, or Mobile App.
	VPS servers offer base capabilities and environment to integrate Node.js apps with developer tools and APIs.
