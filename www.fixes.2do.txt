Really need an email address setup for both websites because having a gmail address looks cheap, it should be for example:
contact@jetsetlux.com
contact@jetsettoken.com
or
enquiry@jetsetlux.com
enquiry@jetsettoken.com

then use grep to search and replace any gmail.com with domain name email

B. current email at bottom of every page is just text, not clickable as expected.

B i.
Current email at bottom of every page is just text it should be a mailto: link
<a href="mailto:contact@jetsetlux.com?subject=Contact%20Us">contact@jetsetlux.com</a>
or a full parameter version:
<a href="mailto:contact@jetsetlux.com,info@jetsetlux.com,?cc=admin@jetsetlux.com&bcc=Dan@eidoloncs.co.uk&subject=Contact%20Us&body=Please%20add%20complete%20relevant%20info.">Contact Us</a>


B ii.
Trawling robots will scrape all pages for email addresses with or without mailto
So could implement via a single line javascript that appends the known part ie. the domain name we are on, then adding the contact name from the page body where the script was called.
Will defeat all but higher end scrapers.
script is javascript that is placed in header:

<script type="text/javascript">
	function contactEmail(name)
	{
	location.href = "mailto:" + name + "@jetsetlux.com?subject=Contact%20Us&body=Please%20add%20complete%20relevant%20info.">Contact Us</a>

</script>

In the text it is called:
<button class="emailBtn" onclick='contactEmail("contact")'>Contact Us</button>

Conventions - Site wide data protocol:

Any spaces in a filename are replaced by the underscore character ("_").

Filenames brief descriptive names in lowercase, with underscore used to separate words if needed.

Full extensions used e.g. html rather than htm

URLs brief descriptive names in lowercase,words can be separated by hyphens as an aid to use and readability for users.

Indents are 1 tab, which is 4 spaces.

UNIX/Linux/Android line termination used.

Character encoding is UTF-8.

Script files have a header comment block describing functionality, individual scripted functions have single line comment description of use and inputs and outputs (if any), global variables are kept to an absolute minimum to maintain data abstraction of classes, methods, procedures, functions.

HEAD
;************************

Start each page in standard format:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
	<head>

	<title></title>

	<meta name="Title" content="">

	<meta name="Description" content="">
	
	<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
	
	<meta name="Keywords" content="">


change language from en-us to en

Ensure title
<60 characters
search result

META description 
< 160 characters 
search snippet

SERPs = 60%+ all searches are from mobiles
META
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">


<meta name="Keywords" content="jetset, token, BEP, 20, luxury, lifestyle, rental, utility, NFT, Miami, Los, Angeles, Las, Vegas"> 
Accurate keywords and hooks and CTA,, chosen for page, all should occur within the page.

Secondary META tags for each page:
<meta name="Robots" content="index, follow">
<meta charset=”utf-8″>

Certik - operational resilience - Content Security Policy (CSP)
<meta http-equiv="content-security-policy" content="default-src 'self'; frame-ancestors ‘self’; form-action ‘self’; upgrade-insecure-requests;">


check if the HSTS is working on your WordPress site. You can launch Google Chrome Devtools, click into the “Network” tab and look at the headers tab


Reduce css and javacript externally loaded files
lux seo:
	The page response time is slow (1:35 seconds).
	This page loads 33 CSS files. This may affect the page load time negatively.
	This page loads 32 JavaScript files. This may affect the load time negatively.
Decrease the javascript files accessed, pages access from 19 to 32 javascript files, this is due to WordPress,

Ideally one css and one js file per site with any page specific styles or code to be included within that pages head.

<link rel="stylesheet" href="lux.css">
	modify css to be more of a responsive design
	font size 16
	ensure css displays videos and images as
	max-width:100%; height:auto;
	

Ensure jetset logo has been converted into full range of icons (ico file holds 3 sizes of file, also apple icons and then files of size
These icons are used when a page within the site is bookmarked, links on desktops will use these files, and the site in the browser address bar will show the icon - it therefore helps present the sites professionalism 
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="favicon.ico">
    
    
;************************
BODY
;************************

[Rod] site structure split into pages to allow more exact keywords per page to get higher rating, include a links page (high quality links for site)

Horizontal navigation bar at top of each page
Breadcrumbs at footer of each page.

Review and improve headings structure.
single H1 per page
lux seo h1 too short - use title (<60 chars) as h1
lux seo - too many h1 tags

H2 - H6 used to correctly sub-categorise the page sections. 
rest of page structure should subdivide using the headings in order
ensure all headings are concise accuate descriptive and that the words are found within their content
lux seo - missing h4 tag

All alt tags should be completed in full, with a complete description of the resource.
Search engine bots rely on this text and heavily weight it, hence good way to add keywords to a page to score and place higher.
It is also used by the partially sighted.

All visual resources (videos, images) should also have a caption tag.

Resources are from https sources, lazy loaded where possible, images converted to webp format.

Content around 800 words per page.
lux seo:
	jetsetlux.com main page 283 words
	Page ontent to be increased from below 300 words to at least 800 words.

Split index.php into pages, more content required.

Thin Content Pages: Avoid indexing pages with minimal or low-quality content. Such pages can include placeholder pages, duplicate content, or pages with very little text. Thin content can harm your website's SEO.


Have 2 AIs running locally using input from scrapers and article spinning, to create a daily inference blog for each site - SERP increased massively by active websites with new content daily.
Using online ChatGPT3 to produce input as well via:
"Repeat as many times as you believe that the content will be of interest to cryptocurrency investors, combine the best headline along with the best sub-headings, hooks, keywords, and call-to-action to create a webpage written using HTML and CSS?"

Jetsettoken.com will have an AI writing a blog on the worldwide crypto news with weighting on token and currency news, low scoring on NFT news.
Jetsetlux.com has a different content writer creating a blog on worldwide NFT news.
To start with each article is vetted to ensure appropriate, before publishing. Later on as the AIs have improved, can just automate by running a search on the article if nothing flags then publish, if flagged then review and edit before publishing.
Within a few months both sites will be appearing much higher in SERPs.  Ideally to aim for a top 10 result with gradually less and less specific search parameters.

Google Business Account created and kept updated

Register websites with Google, Bing, DMOZ

Use Google Analytics and 

Google Search console - review all the terms site currently shows for and what position  they are on in search.
url inspector to test backlink quality

Use ahrefs for site seo

Use Certik security score for data on all aspects of a blockchain project - number of active users per social media form, demographic of most users, etc.

1. Main home/ index page:

1a. log out link in top nav bar links to a missing page:
https://jetsetlux.com/index.php/my-account/customer-logout/?_wpnonce=29c3622a0f

Logically this link should shown log in unless user logged in and then it could show log out.
So this link should be moved to the jetset dApp entrance page, where use of the rental dApp requires Login else Register
If login, the user and password must match the correct entry within the site database, username must be unique, pswd is MD5 encrypted.
Once logged the wallet is loaded if it exists, if no wallet address existing in DB then user given option of connecting a preexisting wallet by entering 12 word mnemonic or creating a new wallet - once wallet added or created its address is stored within DB.
If wallet then list assets linked to address, or curl bscscan data for wallet tokens and token transactional list of last config = numoftrans transactions to show.
With user logged in, wallet loaded, wallet data loaded, offer to connect wallet if this device is owned by you and has an account profile only accessible by you, in which case if accepted, store info locally in static storage cookie (encrypted or hashed as required).
This now offers access to the NFT booking system for luxury rentals by running the browser plugin (if not exist, offer to install first).
So at this point wallet shown and rental dApp access offered by browser plugin.

Log out is available in top nav bar and elsewhere on page after successful login and completion of setup.
wallet address only added to db if successful addition or creation completed, if timepagelive=timeout (e.g. 10 mins) or current session ends then the page upon user return will refresh to login version
cookie only created if data successfully collected and user accepts private device conditions before session ends


1b. very 1st btn 'BOOK NOW' does nothing -  this should be moved to the login screen after sucessful login, wallet connection/creation and load and browser plugin installed = true

1c LEARN MORE -> buttons on the page all go to top of the page, link to info pages

2. Exclusive locations page
https://jetsetlux.com/index.php/services/locations/
2 a. Exclusive locations page has no navigation bar nor to most people any obvious way to main page
it only has a tiny blue link at top of page that links to it self
Add navigation banners to top/header and crumbs to bottom/footer
2 b. Make images clickable anchors to more info and booking form for that location

3. Exclusive packages
3 a.
Make images clickable anchors to more info and booking form for that location
Either make features section stand out way more with font sizes and colour etc.
or move it to top of page with packages below

Missing Headers

Strict-Transport-Security
https://scotthelme.co.uk/hsts-the-missing-link-in-tls/
HTTP Strict Transport Security is an excellent feature to support on your site and strengthens your implementation of TLS by getting the User Agent to enforce the use of HTTPS. Recommended value "Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains".

X-Frame-Options
https://scotthelme.co.uk/hardening-your-http-response-headers/#x-frame-options
X-Frame-Options tells the browser whether you want to allow your site to be framed or not. By preventing a browser from framing your site you can defend against attacks like clickjacking. Recommended value "X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN".

X-Content-Type-Options
https://scotthelme.co.uk/hardening-your-http-response-headers/#x-content-type-options
X-Content-Type-Options stops a browser from trying to MIME-sniff the content type and forces it to stick with the declared content-type. The only valid value for this header is "X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff".

Referrer-Policy
https://scotthelme.co.uk/a-new-security-header-referrer-policy/
Referrer Policy is a new header that allows a site to control how much information the browser includes with navigations away from a document and should be set by all sites.

Permissions-Policy
https://scotthelme.co.uk/goodbye-feature-policy-and-hello-permissions-policy/
Permissions Policy is a new header that allows a site to control which features and APIs can be used in the browser.

;************************
An SEO website audit is essential for the successful performance of a website; this is because it:

Allows a website to discover the reasons behind poor performance in SERPs, be that a negative SEO attack, black hat SEO techniques, or attempting to rank for the wrong keywords

Enables a website to gain insight into what their competitors are doing, and whether their strategies are successful or not

Can help improve your domain authority 

Can drastically improve conversions and sales

Provides more information about the factors that affect ranking in SERPs


An SEO website audit looks into a whole range of elements, these include:

1. Technical Factors
An SEO website audit should take a look into all the backend technical aspects of a website and identify any issues in the website’s coding.

It should analyse the quality of the XML Sitemap, 
Review the page speed 
Assess the website’s crawlability
Look into any duplicate content issues
Check the website is mobile-friendly
Check if the website is using the right redirects, canonical tags, and robots.txt.
2. On-Page Factors
The audit should also check all of the on-page factors. This includes…

Looking at the effectiveness of keyword research and keywords
Analysing the quality of the website’s content and relevance, and UX (User Experience)
Reviewing its meta data, internal linking and backlinks and HTML sitemap
Checking whether images and videos are correctly optimised
3. Competitor Analysis
The website SEO audit should also look into competitor performance. 

It should look into the ranking of competitors 
It should look at how they are using meta-data, keyword placement and backlinks
It show analyse how competitors  engage with their audience, and their social media presence.
Things To Consider For Your SEO Website Audit
There are a few things to take into consideration when conducting your SEO website audit. 

How is your website architecture? Is it easy to navigate and comprehend for both crawlers and users? 
Are you using the right breadcrumbs? 
Are you using JavaScript? Yes? Well, don’t. Even a slight mistake in the Javascript code can lead to you blocking Google bots from crawling your site. Google crawlers can also have trouble understanding Javascript, and you should be aiming to make their task as simple as possible.
Are you using anchor text correctly?
Are your images correctly optimised? Are they accompanied by concise and relevant captions and alt text with keywords.

Is your content well researched, free of grammatical and punctuation errors and easy to read? 

Have you conducted excellent keyword research, and incorporated target keywords in your content. Is it optimised for featured snippets?
