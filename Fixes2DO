A. site wide email address

A i. 
Really need an email address setup for both websites because having a gmail address looks cheap, it should be for example:
contact@jetsetlux.com
contact@jetsettoken.com
or
enquiry@jetsetlux.com
enquiry@jetsettoken.com

then use grep to search and replace any gmail.com with domain name email

B. current email at bottom of every page is just text, not clickable as expected.

B i.
Current email at bottom of every page is just text it should be a mailto: link
<a href="mailto:contact@jetsetlux.com?subject=Contact%20Us">contact@jetsetlux.com</a>
or a full parameter version:
<a href="mailto:contact@jetsetlux.com,info@jetsetlux.com,?cc=admin@jetsetlux.com&bcc=Dan@eidoloncs.co.uk&subject=Contact%20Us&body=Please%20add%20complete%20relevant%20info.">Contact Us</a>


B ii.
Trawling robots will scrape all pages for email addresses with or without mailto
So could implement via a single line javascript that appends the known part ie. the domain name we are on, then adding the contact name from the page body where the script was called.
Will defeat all but higher end scrapers.
script is javascript that is placed in header:

<script type="text/javascript">
	function contactEmail(name)
	{
	location.href = "mailto:" + name + "@jetsetlux.com?subject=Contact%20Us&body=Please%20add%20complete%20relevant%20info.">Contact Us</a>
	}
</script>

In the text it is called:
<button class="emailBtn" onclick='contactEmail("contact")'>Contact Us</button>
